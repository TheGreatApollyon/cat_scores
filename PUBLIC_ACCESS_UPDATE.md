# Public Access Update

## Changes Made

The Event Scoring System has been updated to provide **public access** to the leaderboard while keeping management functions protected.

### URL Structure

#### Public Routes (No Login Required)

- **`/`** - Public leaderboard (redirects to `/overview`)
- **`/overview`** - Cluster leaderboard with live standings

#### Protected Routes (Login Required)

- **`/login`** - Login page
- **`/manage`** - Management dashboard (after login)
- **`/manage/events/*`** - Event management (CRUD operations)
- **`/manage/admin/managers`** - Event Manager account management (Admin only)
- **`/manage/admin/logs`** - Activity logs (Admin only)

### Key Features

1. **Public Leaderboard**

   - Anyone can view the cluster standings at `/` or `/overview`
   - Real-time point totals
   - No authentication required
   - Clean, read-only view

2. **Protected Management**

   - All event creation/editing requires login
   - Access via `/manage` or "Login to Manage" button
   - Role-based access control maintained
   - Secure session management

3. **Navigation Updates**
   - Public view shows "Login to Manage" button
   - Authenticated users see full management menu
   - Brand logo links to public leaderboard
   - Logout redirects to public view
